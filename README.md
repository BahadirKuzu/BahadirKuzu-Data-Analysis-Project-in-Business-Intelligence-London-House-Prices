# London Housing Price Analysis

This project aims to analyze the impact of various factors on housing prices in London. The dataset selected from Kaggle, named "London Housing Price," will be used for descriptive statistics, frequency analysis, and data visualization. Relevant variables will be examined using pie charts and histograms. Additionally, inferential statistics will be used to test three hypotheses. Firstly, it will be investigated whether certain features (such as garden, garage, pool, gym, elevator, fireplace, waterfront, central air, renovated, and natural view) significantly affect house prices in London. Secondly, the study will explore whether there is a statistically significant difference in housing prices based on the number of bedrooms. Lastly, a regression analysis will be conducted to determine if there is a statistically positive relationship between housing prices and the square footage of the house.
